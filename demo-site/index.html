    <h1>Live Demo</h1>
  </div>
  <p>To participate in the demo you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript enabled</li>
    <li>A modern browser</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Strict Input</h2>
  <p>The strict input helper will validate itself to the given Moment format. When the input loses
  focus it will replace its contents with the closest valid match, or erase itself if one cannot be
  found.</p>
  <p>Note: To support the ability to erase an existing date, the "value" is tracked in three
  potential states:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Null - actually and explicitly nothing, changing the value to null will erase the current
    text.</li>
    <li>Undefined - no value set, but retain any existing text value the user has entered.</li>
    <li>String 'x' formatted date.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Taking the given value from the onChange event handler will handle all of this automatically.
  You will just need to be aware of this behaviour when reading the current value in the parent
  state.</p>

  <h2>Direct Use</h2>
  <p>At its core, React Day Input is just a text input that also displays a calendar. It supports
  the normal input events for both the text box and the popup.</p>
  <p>There is no validation built in by default, and in many cases it is more appropriate to write
  your own simple validation above the component.</p>
